summary: "A text based mock bank database written entirely in C/C++"
---

This was a project for ICS 212, one of the programming classes at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The Bank Database features a "front-end" basic text based command line UI, and a "back-end" database system. As the focus of this class was in the education and introduction to the C and C++ programming languages, this project was coded entirely within C++. This database features a menu, with the options for the user to create, locate, and delete "bank accounts" from within the database. With the skills I learned in this project, along with what I learned in ICS 212 in general, I was able to pass LinkedIn's C programming skill assessment.
