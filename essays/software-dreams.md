I truly did not know what I was getting myself into when I chose to pursue computer science. I thought that it was just going to be about coding, but I now know that there is so much more to it than just that. I did not even know what a software engineer was prior to college, but I now know that being a fully fledged SWE is one of the things that I want to achieve the most. Even then, the field of software engineering is itself an extremely wide and diverse field with SWEs doing all sorts of different jobs. 

To be completely honest, I do not yet know exactly what I want to do within the field of software engineering. I am however interested in a wide variety of different subjects within this field. I find machine learning interesting, I find the applications of CS and math in finance to be interesting, and I also find data visualization and analytics to be interesting. I particularly find just writing and researching algorithms themselves to be pretty interesting, as I see them like little puzzles to be solved. 

As I progress through my computer science education here at the university, I hope to gain skills and knowledge of various tools used in web-related development, such as frameworks and databases. I also hope to learn more about the mathematical and theoretical side of CS, and to learn and gain skills related to dealing with big datasets and how to visualize them. Perhaps I may not even become a “pure” SWE, but rather focus more on being a data analyst instead, as that prospect seems pretty intriguing to me. Only the future would be able to tell I guess.
