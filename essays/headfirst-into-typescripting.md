Prior to ICS 341, I have dabbled in other programming languages throughout both the classes that I have taken, and through the experiences which I had in life in general. If you could consider this to be “programming”, my very first experience in anything related to coding was when I was in middle school coding simple games and animations on Scratch, and sharing said games with my friends. I believe that this childhood experience shaped the way I view and think about programming languages. In Scratch, you program by basically connecting blocks of code together as if they were legos, and I still find myself thinking of the programming languages I am currently learning in this way, just simply connecting blocks of text together. It would not be until college where I picked up Java, C, C++, and most recently, JavaScript and TypeScript.

I think TypeScript is a very interesting language. There was a lot that I am already familiar with, such as loops and arrays and what not, but it is the new features in TS that I have never seen before in any other language, along with its surprising similarities, that interested me the most. In terms of its “new features”, out of all the programming languages I have learned thus far, I felt that TS had the most diverse and varied ways of defining variables. The concept of being able to define a variable as an “any”, “unknown”, “never”, or as many of the other special types was very interesting to me. The “enum” feature also very much stood out to me as a very unique and useful aspect of TS, as I thought it would enable one to make a large incremental numeric list very easily and efficiently. One similarity I saw that TS had with the other languages which I have learned previously was in its casting. Besides the “as” keyword, which was another new thing to me, casting with “<>” in TS reminded me of C programming.

In the class ICS 341, where I now study TS and JS, in order to sharpen our skills in both languages we perform “Workout Of the Day”, or WODs in class (and out of class as well for assignments). This is defined as “athletic software engineering” in class, and it reminded me of solving problem sets on Leetcode or, more specifically, of competitive programming. I personally dabbled in competitive programming, taking part in virtual competitions programming solutions to competition (and practice) problem sets on “online judge” websites like Codeforces or AtCoder. When it came to the WODs in class, I very much enjoyed doing them, and I felt almost in my element when it came to them. The only difference is that these WODs require us to write in TS and JS, and I normally use Java in online competitions. I have admittedly not practiced competitive programming in a while, and I am still at quite a beginner level at it as well, but I plan to get back to it soon.
