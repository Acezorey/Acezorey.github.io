In order to get smart and helpful responses, it benefits one to ask smart and helpful questions. This is especially true in a field as technical and mentally demanding as Computer Science, where asking the right question and getting the right response can greatly help one’s work. When software engineers follow the guidelines of what makes a question smart when asking one, it could lead to increased productivity in their team as a whole. When they do not, such a “non-smart” question may end up hindering productivity or even inciting confusion among their peers.

On the website Stackoverflow, where many users constantly ask technical questions, one example of a smart question would be [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8495687/split-array-into-chunks/8495740#8495740). This question is a smart one as it is very concise, simple, is easy to understand and answer, and gets straight to the point. Hence, the response received by this question is one that is equally concise, simple, and easy to understand.

[This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32901409/confusion-between-worst-case-running-time-and-omega-notation) would be an example of a not-so-smart question. Although quite concise, it is very vague. There are many different ways to answer this question, and the way it is asked makes it hard to ascertain exactly what kind of information the asker wants. Hence, one of its replies is that of confusion: another user asking exactly what does the original asker want to know.

From this experience, I have learned that I should make sure that the questions I ask are to be concise, specific, and easy to understand and answer. Although I seek the help of others, by asking smart questions, I would in turn be helping them to help me.
