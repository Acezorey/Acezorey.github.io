## Initial thoughts

I am sure that in the eyes of many, especially to students studying computer science and/or programming, the idea of coding standards or a coding style is that it is a tedious thing that elicits feelings of mild irritation when working on a project or assignment that demands it. I should know because I was one of those students. 

Prior to college, I did not even know that such standards existed in programming, and throughout some of my earliest programming classes I was pretty much able to structure my code however I wanted to. When I first encountered coding standards, it came as a shock to me, that I now had to follow strict rules on the code that I type out. Indeed I did think it was an irritating thing at the time.

However, after experiencing programming according to certain standards, and after learning about why said standards exist at all, I know better now about the importance of such things, and I now also appreciate them. It may be hard for us students to see why such standards are important, probably because we mostly wrote code individually amongst ourselves, rarely ever having to work with other large groups of people. In the workplace however that is a completely different story, and the existence of coding styles in my mind no doubt provides tangible and crucial benefits.

## Standardization and "Code Cleanliness"

One of the biggest benefits to code standards that I can think of (and one which all other benefits likely build off of) is that it standardizes code. Hypothetically, if a company were to not follow any kind of coding standard when it came to their software, the code behind their software would become very messy very, very quickly. Having a rigid standardization is essential to keep code uniformed, and it is especially essential to have when you have potentially hundreds of people working on the same codebase. 

This also promotes what I think of as “Code Cleanliness”, or predictability. If every single one of those hundreds of developers stuck to the same coding standard, and if you were a developer trying to access the same codebase, you would be able to see exactly what you expect to see when it comes to the code. Every line of code would be styled predictably, as is outlined in the standard, and the source code would also look neater and more uniform.

## Practicality

This standardized cleanliness in code also comes with added benefits. Because coding standards allow for code to be made neat and uniform, this would make the code easier to read. Easier to read code is code that can be more easily maintained or worked upon. I would imagine as a developer in such a company, I would likely have to work on code someone else has written, and there would likely be someone who would have to work on code that I have written. If no coding standard was followed, this would make the job far harder, now having to decipher what the other person had written.

This additionally makes the code far more scalable, and reduces the risk of problems such as spaghetti code. If there comes a future company project that aims to add on new features to an already existing codebase, having a uniformed and easy to understand code makes it way easier to modify existing code, or add on new code which works with the older ones. This would also likely allow the project to be completed faster, which can make the company more money in the long run.

## Closing Thoughts

Coding standards can initially be a very tedious and perhaps even frustrating thing to follow, especially to those new to programming. When it comes to practical programming in the industry however, coding standards offer very real and tangible benefits to those working on developing software, and the lack of having coding standards can be far, far more frustrating and tedious to deal with. Learning and getting used to following standards early on into your education and/or career can benefit you greatly in the long run.
